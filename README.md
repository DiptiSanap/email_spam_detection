➡ Spam Mail Detection Using Natural Language Processing & Supervised Machine Learning

➡ What is Spam Mail?
- Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk.

➡ Problem Statement
- To detect if an email is spam (1) or not (0)

➡ What is Natural Language Processing?
- Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written -- referred to as natural language. It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).
- There are two main phases to natural language processing: 

1) Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing involves preparing and "cleaning" text data for machines to be able to analyze it.

2) Algorithm Development
- Once the data has been preprocessed, an algorithm is developed to process it. Two main types are commonly used:
1) Rules-based system - This system uses carefully designed linguistic rules. This approach was used early on in the development of natural language processing, and is still used.
2) Machine learning-based system. Machine learning algorithms use statistical methods. They learn to perform tasks based on training data they are fed and adjust their methods as more data is processed.

➡ Why is natural language processing important?
- Businesses use massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data and need a way to efficiently process it. This is where natural language processing is useful.

➡ Techniques and Methods Used are as follows
1) Data Preprocessing
- Removing Punctuations : Natural English strings are not easily processed; hence we need to remove punctuation from strings before we can use them for further processing.
- Tokenization : Tokenization is used in natural language processing to split paragraphs and sentences into smaller units that can be more easily assigned meaning.
- Removing Stop words :  Stop words are used to remove unimportant words, allowing applications to focus on the important words instead.

2) Machine Learning System
- Count Vectorizer : Countvectorizer is a method to convert text to numerical data for feature extraction & processing.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm : It is a Bayesian learning approach popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The program guesses the tag of a text, such as an email or a newspaper story, using the Bayes theorem. It calculates each tag's likelihood for a given sample and outputs the tag with the greatest chance.
- Model Evaluation

➡ Business Application
- To detect the spam mails and to optimize the data storage.
